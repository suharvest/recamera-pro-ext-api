"""
Capability registry for the L0 adapter layer (docs/guide/kit-design.md §L0,
docs/guide/adapter-bootstrap.md §3).

At startup the kit probes whether the *official* firmware endpoints exist, and
every adapter factory picks its implementation from the resulting capability
set:

    FrameSource  = caps.frame_broker   ? OfficialFrameSource  : FfmpegRtspSource
    ResultSink   = caps.result_ingress ? OsdInjectResultSink  : WsResultSink
    AudioSource  = caps.audio_broker   ? OfficialPcmSource     : (workaround TBD)
    ControlPlane = caps.control_api    ? OfficialControl       : CgiControl
    ProbeSource  = ProbeSource (SDK)   -- v1 baseline (probe@1), no workaround alt

On today's firmware (6.1.157) none of the official endpoints exist, so every
factory selects the existing verified workaround and behaviour is byte-for-byte
unchanged. When a firmware upgrade adds an official endpoint, the next probe
hits, the factory returns the `Official*` implementation, and **no application
code and no repackaging is required** -- exactly the "smooth migration" contract
in docs/guide/adapter-bootstrap.md §3.

Overrides (both for real deployments and for testing the switch logic)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* `RECAMERA_FRAME_SOCK` / `RECAMERA_AUDIO_SOCK` -- point the probe at a custom
  socket path (lets a test create a fake socket and prove the switch).
* `RECAMERA_RESULT_INGRESS` / `RECAMERA_CONTROL_API` -- "1"/"0" to force those
  (currently un-probeable) capabilities on/off.
* `RECAMERA_ADAPTER_PREFER` = `auto` (default) | `official` | `workaround`
  -- a global manifest-style override of the per-capability auto selection
  (docs/guide/adapter-bootstrap.md §3: "可留 manifest 里 prefer: official|workaround 供覆盖").

         future VQE-clean broker; still a stub on shipping firmware.

         path: capture the firmware's reserved ALSA `ai_asr` dsnoop PCM via
         arecord (+ ffmpeg loudnorm/ch0-select). Shares the mic with rkipc (no

         is cleaner than the RTSP workaround (no rkipc encode/transcode hop) and
         is therefore the default. NOTE: raw mic, no VQE -- app does its own
         denoise/AEC (see docs/guide/audio-pcm.md; AEC reference is in ch2/ch3).
      3. `RtspAudioSource` (fallback / A-B comparison, `prefer="rtsp"`) --
         demuxes the audio track from rkipc's combined RTSP stream via ffmpeg.
         Also non-invasive; kept as a fallback for hosts where `/dev/snd` access
         is unavailable (e.g. running as the SSH `admin` user, not root).
      4. `AlsaTakeoverSource` (degraded fallback, `prefer="alsa"`) -- direct
         `hw:0,0` takeover via arecord. On shipping firmware the raw mic is held
         exclusively by rkipc, so its `open()` raises `AudioDeviceBusy` unless
         the caller opts into freeing it (which blips video). Prefer ai_asr,
         which shares the mic instead of fighting for it.
