server.py -- appmgr orchestration + minimal loopback HTTP API.

Orchestration (list / install / switch / stop) lives here as plain functions so
both the CLI (`python3 -m appmgr ...`) and the HTTP server share one code path.

Concurrency (APP_CENTER_PORT_DESIGN §4.1):
  * BUSY-GATE: every mutating op (install/switch/stop) takes an flock on
    busy.lock, serialising them; a second concurrent mutation gets "busy".
  * SINGLE-INSTANCE: the HTTP daemon takes an flock on appmgr.lock at startup;
    a second daemon exits rather than double-binding :8130.

API (loopback 127.0.0.1:8130; nginx /_jwt_verify guards the public edge):
  GET  /api/appMgr/list      -> installed apps + manifest + running + active
  GET  /api/appMgr/icon?id=  -> the app's package-bundled icon.<ext> bytes
                                (image/png|webp|jpeg). manifest's `image` field
                                points at /appcenter/apps/<id>.png, which serves
                                only .tar.gz + catalog and therefore 404s on the
                                device; this endpoint serves the icon out of the
                                install dir instead, so a third-party app can
                                have a card image without shipping it inside the
                                front-end bundle. `icon_url` in /list points here
                                (null when the package ships no icon).
  GET  /api/appMgr/assets?paths=a/b.rknn,c.mvn
                             -> per-path {present,size?,sha256?} under the shared
                                model root + free_bytes, so the front end can skip
                                a model that is already on the device instead of
                                re-fetching and re-uploading it (INSTALL_ASSETS_SPEC
                                §1; the 133 MB voice model cannot beat nginx's
                                proxy_read_timeout). Digests are memoized on
                                (size, mtime_ns, inode) -- see assets.py.
  GET  /api/appMgr/runtime?name=voice
                             -> is the on-demand audio runtime importable in

  POST /api/appMgr/switch    {id}   (single-active: stop old active, start id)
  POST /api/appMgr/stop      {id?}  (stop id, or current active)
  POST /api/appMgr/upload    raw tar.gz bytes + X-Filename header
                             -> stage under /userdata/appstage, return device path
                             (browser-relayed cloud install: the browser fetches a
                              catalog package, sha256-verifies it, uploads here,
                              then calls /install with the returned path)
  POST /api/appMgr/putModel  raw model bytes + X-Filename + X-Target-Path
