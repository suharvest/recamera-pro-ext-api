"""voiceruntime.py -- on-demand audio runtime for apps with capabilities:["audio"].

Motivation (INSTALL_ASSETS_SPEC §3): voice-transcribe needs five aarch64/cp311
wheels (sherpa_onnx_core, sherpa_onnx, sentencepiece, kaldi_native_fbank,
voxedge, ~18 MB). Putting them in the kit package would make all nine vision apps
re-download 18 MB they never import on every kit update, so the bundle ships
separately and is installed only when an audio app is installed. Without it the
app installs fine and then dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'voxedge'`.

Mechanism is deliberately the one that already exists -- release/kit-extra
INSTALL.sh's `pip install --no-index --find-links <wheels>` into /userdata/rknnenv
(the device has no network). The bundle reaches the device through the same
browser-relayed POST /api/appMgr/upload used for app packages, so nothing new is
introduced on the transport side either.

Two properties the spec calls out:

  * PRESENCE IS AN IMPORT, NOT A FILE LISTING. `.dist-info` on disk proves a wheel
    was unpacked, not that it loads: sherpa_onnx pulls a native libonnxruntime out
    of sherpa_onnx_core, and a wheel built for the wrong ABI unpacks perfectly and
    then fails at import. So the check runs `import voxedge, sherpa_onnx` inside
    the TARGET venv's interpreter, as a subprocess.
  * FAILURE NAMES THE PACKAGE. The probe reports which module failed and with what
    error, and install() surfaces pip's own stderr tail, because "runtime install
    failed" on a headless device costs an SSH session to turn into a fact.

Idempotent: install() probes first and returns already_present without running
pip.

Second shape -- FILES (RUNTIME_BUNDLE_SPEC §1/§2)
------------------------------------------------
The GStreamer RK hardware codec runtime distributes three `.so` files and three
environment variables, not wheels. Registry entries therefore carry a `kind`:

  * kind "wheels" (the DEFAULT, so the existing `voice` entry is untouched):
    install = offline pip into the venv, presence = import in that venv.
  * kind "files": install = unpack into `dest` (which must live under /userdata,
    checked with paths.is_within), presence = the `probe` command exits 0, and
    the entry additionally declares `env` that supervisor merges into the process
    environment of apps that DECLARE the matching capability.

Presence stays a real check in both shapes: a `.so` copied into place proves
nothing (wrong ABI, missing dependency, stale GStreamer registry all leave the
file exactly where it should be), so `gst-inspect-1.0 mppvideodec` is what
decides, not os.path.exists.
