paths.py -- filesystem layout + small helpers for appmgr.

All state lives under /userdata (survives OTA per APP_CENTER_PORT_DESIGN §4.7).
Every constant is env-overridable so the module can run against a temp tree on a
dev box (used by the zip-slip unit test).

Device layout (reconciled -- kit is ONE shared copy, apps hold only apps):

    /userdata/local/kit/kit/            shared Kit package  (PYTHONPATH parent = /userdata/local/kit)
    /userdata/local/apps/<id>/          installed app: manifest.json, app.py, models/,
                                        run.{pid,pgid,boot_id}, logs/
    /userdata/local/apps/state.json     desired/observed app lifecycle state
    /userdata/local/appmgr/resources.json  durable resource allocations
    /userdata/local/appmgr/             appmgr code + locks
